<h1>ðŸ’€ Goth Summoner â€“ Project 5 of The Code Fool's Journey</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<h3>Situation</h3>
<p>What if your keyboard could be used to summon monsters from the shadows? <strong>Goth Summoner</strong> is a dark-fantasy terminal game where you channel chaotic energies and pit creatures like werewolves, vampires, and zombies against each other in a magical duel. This project was designed to practice <strong>input handling</strong>, <strong>conditional logic</strong>, and <strong>loops</strong> in a fun and thematic way.</p>

<h3>Task</h3>
<p>The goal was to build a turn-based battle game that lets the player choose a magical sigil and summon a monster each round. The summoned monster fights a randomly chosen enemy, and the outcome is decided using logic similar to rock-paper-scissors. The player must win more rounds than they lose across five turns to earn the title of Master Summoner.</p>

<h3>Action</h3>
<p>I implemented a ritual-like interface with themed messages, character emojis (optional), and intuitive user inputs. The game uses <strong>control structures</strong> to handle win/loss logic, track the number of victories, and display a final result based on performance. Randomness drives the enemy's moves, while the player must make strategic choices.</p>

<h3>Result</h3>
<p>The result is an immersive terminal-based game that merges logic practice with gothic aesthetics. It strengthens my understanding of control flow, randomization, and user input across <strong>JavaScript</strong>, <strong>C++</strong>, and <strong>Python</strong>. This project also inspired me to explore stylized narrative integration in game mechanics â€” something I plan to do even more in future games.</p>

<h2>Multi-Language Learning Philosophy</h2>
<p>This project, like the others in The Code Foolâ€™s Journey, was written in Python, JavaScript, and C++ to reinforce universal programming concepts. Each language poses different challenges in syntax and implementation, allowing me to strengthen my core understanding of logic structures, loops, user input handling, and random generation. By recreating the same idea in multiple languages, I train my mind to think in code beyond specific syntax quirks.</p>

<h2>Project Scope: Goth Summoner</h2>
<p>Core concepts covered (in addition to concepts from previous projects):</p>
<ul>
  <li>Conditional Logic (Rock-Paper-Scissors mechanic)</li>
  <li>User Input (with validation)</li>
  <li>Loops & Counters</li>
  <li>Randomization</li>
  <li>Theming & Terminal UX</li>
</ul>

<h1>About the Code Fool's Journey</h1>
<p>The Code Fool's Journey is inspired by the 22 Major Arcana of the Tarot, acting as both a programming curriculum and a spiritual quest. Each project corresponds to a stage in the Foolâ€™s growth â€” not just in power, but in understanding. From the first humble variables to complex simulations, GUIs, and beyond, this series seeks to combine coding mastery with storytelling, symbolism, and artistic intent.</p>

<h1>Fork the Shadows</h1>
<p>If you find value in this project, youâ€™re welcome to fork it, remix it, or summon your own monsters with it. The goth path of code is open to all who dare to walk between logic and lunacy. ðŸ¦‡</p>
