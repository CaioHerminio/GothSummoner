<h1>ðŸ’€ Goth Summoner â€“ Project 5 of The Code Fool's Journey</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<h3>Situation</h3>
<p>What if your keyboard could be used to summon monsters from the shadows? <strong>Goth Summoner</strong> is a dark-fantasy terminal game where you summon werewolves, vampires, and zombies against each other in a magical duel. This project was designed to practice <strong>loops</strong> in a fun and thematic way, instead of the classic rock-paper-scissors game.</p>

<h3>Task</h3>
<p>The goal was to build a turn-based battle game that lets the player choose a magical sigil and summon a monster each round. The summoned monster fights a randomly chosen enemy, and the outcome is decided using logic similar to rock-paper-scissors. The player must win more rounds than they lose across five turns to earn the title of Master Summoner.</p>

<h3>Action</h3>
<p>I implemented a ritual-like interface with themed messages, character emojis (optional), and intuitive user inputs. The game uses <strong>control structures</strong> to handle win/loss logic, track the number of victories, and display a final result based on performance. Randomness drives the enemy's moves.</p>

<h3>Result</h3>
<p>The result is a simple but immersive terminal-based game that merges logic practice with gothic aesthetics. It strengthens my understanding of control flow, randomization, and user input across <strong>JavaScript</strong>, <strong>C++</strong>, and <strong>Python</strong>. This project also inspired me to explore stylized narrative integration in game mechanics â€” something I plan to do even more in future games.</p>

<h2>Multi-Language Learning Philosophy</h2>
<p>Just like the first project, this one is being developed in Python, JavaScript, and C++. Iâ€™m studying these three languages simultaneously to avoid becoming too attached to the quirks of just one. This method helps me grasp the core logic of programming â€” which is universal across languages â€” rather than memorizing syntax. By rewriting the same project in multiple languages, I reinforce my understanding of structures, variables, functions, and flow â€” while also appreciating the expressive power of each language.</p>

<h1>About the Code Fool's Journey</h1>
<p>The Fool's Journey is similar to Joseph Campbellâ€™s famous Heroâ€™s Journey, but instead of 12 stages, it follows 22 stages, based on the 22 Major Arcana of the Tarot. Each card represents an archetype in the evolution of the protagonist, the Fool, who embarks on a path toward knowledge and personal power, just like programmers and artists. Here, each project increases in complexity and covered concepts, from simple variables and data types to APIs, Memory Management, Databases and GUI.</p>

<h1>Feel Free to Fork the Journey</h1>
<p>If you find this helpful for learning or teaching, you're welcome to fork, improve, or remix it in your own way. The Foolâ€™s path is yours to walk â€” and code â€” however you like.ðŸ˜Š</p>
